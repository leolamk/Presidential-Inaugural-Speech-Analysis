### [Project Description](doc/)
Inauguration speech is a ceremony marking the commencement of a new term of President of America. Often, in this speech, President addresses his policies and future presidential plans. In this study, our goal is to investigate the unfound pattern in these speeches. We focus on the differences in between Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents as well as Presidents who received graduate school education and Presidents who did not. We want to see if different educational and political backgrounds will have impacts on the topic, word length, sentence length, and emotion of their inauguration speeches.
